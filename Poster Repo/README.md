# Thyroid Cancer Pathology Abstraction — Replication Package

This repository accompanies the poster:

> **Evaluating Open-Source Large Language Models for Automated Abstraction of Thyroid Cancer Pathology Data**

## What this is

Seven open-weight LLMs were evaluated on zero-shot structured data extraction from
200 TCGA-THCA (The Cancer Genome Atlas Thyroid Carcinoma) pathology reports.
The task: extract five registry-style variables and compare against TCGA clinical labels.

**The central artifact is `prompt.md`** — a registry-style abstraction prompt that encodes
extraction rules, section priorities, and tie-breaking logic for each variable. Performance
was driven more by prompt quality than model size. Pre-computed results are in `results/`.

## Results (weighted F1, held-out test set, N=200)

## To reproduce

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set up API keys

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your keys
```

Free Groq accounts can run all models except Mistral-Large (which uses OpenRouter).
Model availability may change — check [groq.com](https://groq.com) and [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
for current model IDs. All models were run at `temperature=0.0`.

### 3. Run inference

```bash
# Run all models
python src/run_inference.py

# Run specific models
python src/run_inference.py --models llama-3.1-8b llama-3.3-70b
```

Outputs are saved to `output/predictions_{model}.csv`. Runs are idempotent —
already-completed cases are skipped if you re-run.

### 4. Evaluate

```bash
python src/evaluate.py
```

This prints a weighted F1 table to stdout. To save results:

```bash
python src/evaluate.py --output results/my_run.csv
```

## Data

Pathology reports in `data/reports/` are parsed markdown text extracted from TCGA-THCA PDFs.
The original PDFs and clinical XMLs are available from the NCI GDC portal
(requires free registration): [https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/).
Search for project TCGA-THCA.

Gold standard labels in `data/gold_standard.csv` were derived from the corresponding
TCGA clinical XML files.

## Notes on reproducibility

- Model outputs may differ slightly from the study due to API updates or model version changes.
  The study used fixed model versions as listed in the poster.
- The prompt in `prompt.md` and `src/run_inference.py` is identical to the one used in the study.
- Results without re-running inference are available in `results/summary_metrics.csv`.
